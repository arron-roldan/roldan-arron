During my college days, I focused on studying computer and web developing, which provided me with hands-on experience and helped me develop my technical skills. I have such a many good friends all the time we care each other to help in any problems like in school activity that my professor gave to us. But now we are only 9 because of the reblocking of our section in school we sad but this is not a chance to lose hope that we cannot meet again. In our group chat we make happy moments so they did not miss everyone.
