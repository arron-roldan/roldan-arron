In high school, I had the opportunity to explore my interests through various extracurricular activities, such as the debate team and volunteering at a local animal shelter, which helped me develop my leadership skills and passion for community service. That's why i love dog and for the first time of my life i have a dog her name is Apple but she passed away because she sick and i dont have enough money to go her in veterinary
