<center> On July 20, 2002, the world welcomed me into it, and I have been on a journey of growth and discovery ever since. Everyone love's me but i did not forget my grand father because he will care for me since my mom have a second baby so i really appreciate my grand father that all of his sacrifice to me is such a good.  </center>
